Chrome Extension that replaces Unicode Regional Indicators with images of actual flags.

Style (Twitter/Apple etc.), Size and Position of Flags can be changed.

## TODO

* Fix bug where flags don't work in Youtube titles (except sometimes when they work?)
* Fix bug where sometimes a comment that has flags from the previous page you were on is mixed with the first comment on the current video (????)
* Add subdivisions? (UK ones are the only ones supported by most vendors)
* Add On/Off button
