# ChromeFlagEmojis

Chrome Extension that replaces Unicode Regional Indicators with images of actual flags.

## TODO

* ~~Add Icons~~
* Fix bug where flags don't work in Youtube titles (except sometimes when they work?)
* ~~Explain what "CSS" means in Settings~~
* Add subdivisions? (UK ones are the only ones supported by most vendors)
