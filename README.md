# ChromeFlagEmojis

Chrome Extension that replaces Unicode Regional Indicators with images of actual flags. (Note: Which Flags are included has nothing to do with any personal political opinions and is defined only by what the Unicode consortium recommends for [General Interchange](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-zwj-sequences.html))

## Overview

Makes flags in text look like this:

## TODO

* Fix bug where sometimes a comment that has flags from the previous page you were on is mixed with the first comment on the current video (????)
* Add On/Off button
* Add offline option
* Add other subdivions? There are a couple that only OpenMoji supports (California, Texas, Bretagne, Catalonia, Basque Country, Quebec, Berlin, Asturias)
